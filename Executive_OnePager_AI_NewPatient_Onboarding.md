# AI-Native New‑Patient Onboarding (White‑Label) — Executive Brief

**Who this is for**: 5+ clinician practices starting with **OB‑GYN** and **Podiatry** (expandable to other specialties).  
**Goal**: Increase patient retention and satisfaction by capturing **complete, accurate information at first touch**, pre‑populating the EHR, and eliminating re‑asking.

---

## The Problem
Patients encounter long forms, repeated questions, and phone tag. Staff spend hours re‑keying data and fixing insurance errors. This creates **friction, delays, denials, and drop‑off**.

## Our Solution (Agentic, Omni‑channel, HIPAA‑ready)
A **white‑label** AI assistant that meets patients wherever they are:
- **Phone/Voice**: Natural‑language call router replaces IVR; detects emergencies; gathers basics; reads/records voice consent.
- **Web/Mobile**: Secure magic‑link intake (ID + insurance capture with AI OCR), guided history, pharmacy preference, e‑sign consents.
- **SMS/Email/WhatsApp**: Reminders and nudge messages with **no PHI**; PHI collected only within the secure web flow.
- **EHR + RCM**: Day‑1 **read/write** to leading EHRs (Athena/eCW/NextGen), plus **real‑time eligibility (X12 270/271)**.

## Why It Matters
- **Less Friction**: Patients complete intake before arrival; staff focus on care.
- **Fewer Errors**: Automated eligibility, payer/plan mapping, and anomaly flags (duplicate patient, mismatch, missing referral).
- **Faster Throughput**: Shorter check‑in; first‑pass clean claims improve cash flow.
- **Retention**: A friendly, effortless first experience keeps patients coming back.

## What the Pilot Includes (Florida start)
- OB‑GYN & Podiatry **intake templates** (EN/ES), e‑sign consents, accessibility (WCAG/508).
- Voice AI line + secure mobile intake; **insurance OCR + RT eligibility**; pharmacy verification.
- Staff console + **EHR write‑back** (demographics, coverage, consents, intake summaries).
- Privacy posture: **BAA**, encryption, MFA, audit trail, least‑privilege roles.

## How We Work With You
1. **Discovery (1–2 wks)** — brand skinning, templates, call flows.  
2. **Pilot (6–10 wks)** — live with one OB‑GYN site; measure friction & completion.  
3. **Scale (post‑pilot)** — add locations, deeper integrations (HIE/TEFCA), outbound voice, and analytics.

## Call to Action
We’re inviting a small set of partners to **co‑develop and pilot** the platform.  
**Let’s launch a patient experience that feels modern, effortless, and trustworthy.**
