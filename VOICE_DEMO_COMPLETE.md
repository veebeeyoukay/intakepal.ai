## 💡 Talking Points

### "Why This Matters"
- **43% of patients** abandon phone intakes due to long hold times
- **60% of intake errors** come from manual re-keying
- **Staff spend 15-20 minutes** per new patient on the phone
- **IntakePal cuts this to <2 minutes** with automated collection

### "What Makes It Different"
- **Voice-first design**, not a bolt-on feature
- **Conversational AI**, not rigid IVR menus
- **Safety-aware**, with emergency detection
- **Continuity**, from voice to web without data loss

### "What's Next" (Roadmap Tease)
- **Phase 2**: Real voice (Web Speech API)
- **Phase 3**: AI voice (ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced NLP (GPT-4 for understanding)
- **Phase 5**: Voice biometrics for identity

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Demo Mode)

1. **Text-only input** - Real voice coming in Phase 2
2. **Keyword matching** - Advanced NLP (GPT-4) in Phase 3
3. **Fixed script** - Dynamic conversations in Phase 4
4. **Session storage** - Production uses secure database
5. **No recording** - Twilio integration in production

**IMPORTANT**: These are demo limitations, not product limitations. The architecture supports all planned features.
